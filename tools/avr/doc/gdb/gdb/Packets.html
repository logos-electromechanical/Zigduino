<h3 class="section">D.2 Packets</h3>

<p>The following table provides a complete list of all currently defined
<var>command</var>s and their corresponding response <var>data</var>. 
See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for details about the File
I/O extension of the remote protocol.

   <p>Each packet's description has a template showing the packet's overall
syntax, followed by an explanation of the packet's meaning.  We
include spaces in some of the templates for clarity; these are not
part of the packet's syntax.  No <span class="sc">gdb</span> packet uses spaces to
separate its components.  For example, a template like `<samp><span class="samp">foo
</span><var>bar</var> <var>baz</var></samp>' describes a packet beginning with the three ASCII
bytes `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', followed by a <var>bar</var>, followed directly by a
<var>baz</var>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not transmit a space character between the
`<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' and the <var>bar</var>, or between the <var>bar</var> and the
<var>baz</var>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040var_007bthread_002did_007d_002c-in-remote-protocol-2066"></a><a name="thread_002did-syntax"></a>
Several packets and replies include a <var>thread-id</var> field to identify
a thread.  Normally these are positive numbers with a target-specific
interpretation, formatted as big-endian hex strings.  A <var>thread-id</var>
can also be a literal `<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>' to indicate all threads, or `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to
pick any thread.

   <p>In addition, the remote protocol supports a multiprocess feature in
which the <var>thread-id</var> syntax is extended to optionally include both
process and thread ID fields, as `<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.</span><var>tid</var></samp>'. 
The <var>pid</var> (process) and <var>tid</var> (thread) components each have the
format described above: a positive number with target-specific
interpretation formatted as a big-endian hex string, literal `<samp><span class="samp">-1</span></samp>'
to indicate all processes or threads (respectively), or `<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>' to
indicate an arbitrary process or thread.  Specifying just a process, as
`<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var></samp>', is equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">p</span><var>pid</var><span class="samp">.-1</span></samp>'.  It is an
error to specify all processes but a specific thread, such as
`<samp><span class="samp">p-1.</span><var>tid</var></samp>'.  Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">p</span></samp>' prefix is <em>not</em> used
for those packets and replies explicitly documented to include a process
ID, rather than a <var>thread-id</var>.

   <p>The multiprocess <var>thread-id</var> syntax extensions are only used if both
<span class="sc">gdb</span> and the stub report support for the `<samp><span class="samp">multiprocess</span></samp>'
feature using `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>'.  See <a href="multiprocess-extensions.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>, for
more information.

   <p>Note that all packet forms beginning with an upper- or lower-case
letter, other than those described here, are reserved for future use.

   <p>Here are the packet descriptions.

of view, nothing actually happened.</em>

Specifying multiple

     <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>' action is only relevant in non-stop mode

A stop reply should be generated for any affected thread not already stopped.

the corresponding stop reply should indicate that the thread has stopped with

     <p>A memory breakpoint is implemented by replacing the instruction at

<var>length</var> is used by targets that indicates the size of the

     <p><em>Implementation note: It is possible for a target to copy or move
